## Description

This is the client software for Racing+, a Binding of Isaac: Repentance racing platform. Normally a single player game, the Lua mod, client, and server allow players to be able to race each other in real time.

The client is written with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and uses WebSockets to communicate with the server. The pretty elements are courtesy of [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).

## Dependency Notes

- We cannot update to the latest version of `electron` due to a bug with it not sending the previously gotten cookie when establishing a websocket connection.
- We cannot update to the latest version of `node-fetch` and `@types/node-fetch` due to TypeScript not supporting ESM-only modules.
